# Thesis

### Thesis is a CMS gem that integrates as seamlessly as possible into your current Rails website.

Most Rails content management systems make you conform to their system from the start, 
making it difficult to just "drop in" the gem and make it work with your CMS. Thesis
tries to be a drop-in CMS that doesn't hijack your development workflow and stays out
of the way.

### Requirements

* Rails 3.2.x (or higher)
* Ruby 1.9.3 (or higher)

Thesis might work with earlier versions but that's not our focus.

## Getting Started

### Installation

In your Gemfile:

    gem 'thesis'
    
Then run these from your command line:

    bundle install
    rails g thesis:install
    rake db:migrate
    
This will install thesis and add the database tables.

### Authentication

**Thesis does not force you to use a particular authentication strategy.**

Instead, it adds a method into your application_controller.rb file that
allows you to hook up your own authentication logic.

* If you return `false` from this method, nothing will show up client-side nor will the page be editable.
* If you return `true` from this method, the Thesis editor will appear and the page will be editable.

```ruby
# Thesis authentication
def page_is_editable?(page)
  # Add your own criteria here for editing privileges. Examples:
  # current_user.admin? # Basic admin
  # can? :update, page # CanCan
  true # EVERYONE has access right now.
end
```

### Page Templates

Thesis's installer will drop a `page_templates` folder into your `app/views` folder.
This is where you put different styles of pages for use in the CMS.
Thesis will install an ERB, [HAML](http://haml.info), or [Slim](http://slim-lang.com) version, depending on your configuration.

#### Meta information

Pages come with a few built-in fields for use in meta tags.

```haml
%title= current_page.title
%meta{ content: current_page.description, type: "description" }
```

#### Thesis Editor

Place this right after your opening `body` tag to embed the Thesis editor. It will only show
up if your `page_is_editable?` method returns `true`.

```haml
%body
  = thesis_editor
```

#### Page title

```haml
%h1= current_page.title
```

#### Primary Navigation

Use `root_pages` to get a list of pages at the root level. You can use the
page's `name` and `path` accessors in your links.

```haml
%nav
  %ul
    %li= link_to "Home", root_path # You can mix and match dynamic and static pages
    - root_pages.each do |p|
      %li= link_to p.name, p.path
    %li= link_to "Static Page", static_page_path
```

#### Page content

Content areas are accessible from any page using the `content` method. This method
takes two arguments: name and type. Type defaults to `:html`. The only other type
is `:text` (for now) which is plain text, no HTML accepted.

Both content types will wrap their content in a `<div>` or `<span>`.

Referencing a content area in a page template will create one if it doesn't exist already.

```haml
%article
  = current_page.content("Main Content", :html)
%aside
  = current_page.content("Sidebar Content", :html)  
%footer
  %p= current_page.content("Footer Content", :text)
```

### Routing
        
Thesis will also add a route handler to your `routes.rb` file. This will 
automatically handle routes for pages you create with Thesis.

    thesis_routes
    
**To improve performance, put it near the bottom of your `routes.rb` file.**

## What Thesis Isn't

You can't have it all or it becomes the same as the other bloated content management systems
out there. This is a list of what it's not and what it's not ever likely to be.

We reserve the right to change our mind, however, especially with well planned and written
pull requests to help prod us in the right direction. :-)

1. A WordPress Replacement
2. A full featured CMS
3. A full featured WYSIWYG editor
4. An authentication or permission system
5. A gem that works well with Sinatra or non-ActiveRecord ORMs
6. Anything other than a basic editor for pages and page content

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Write tests for your new feature
5. Run `rake spec` to ensure that all tests pass # TODO: implement tests
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
7. Create new Pull Request
